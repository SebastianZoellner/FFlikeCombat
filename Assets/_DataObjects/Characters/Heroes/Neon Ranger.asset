  shortBlurb: 'Neon Ranger, formerly known as Jesse Ryder, was born and raised in
    Neo-Western City. From a young age, Jesse showcased a natural talent for sharpshooting
    and a keen sense of justice, often inspired by tales of old Western lawmen. As
    he grew older, he decided to don the mantle of a modern-day vigilante to protect
    his city from the rising tide of corruption and crime that infiltrated its neon
    streets.

    

    After witnessing a brutal takeover of a local district
    by a powerful syndicate known as "The Syndicate of Shadows," Jesse vowed to take
    action. Utilizing his expertise in both traditional and cutting-edge weaponry,
    he crafted a unique suit equipped with energy pistols and a shield generator,
    combining the ruggedness of a cowboy with the technology of the future. His attire,
    highlighted by vibrant neon accents, became a symbol of hope for the citizens.'
