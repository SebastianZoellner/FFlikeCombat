  missionBriefing: 'Stop the hijacking in progress and secure the truck while ensuring
    the safety of all involved.


    At 14:30 hours, a cargo truck carrying critical
    supplies was hijacked by an unknown group of assailants. The truck is currently
    traveling south on Highway 47 at high speeds, creating a significant threat to
    civilian safety and property. We need to stop the truck, capture the highjackers
    and make sure nobody gets hurt!


    We don''t know how many assailants we are
    dealing with, but they seem to armed with high-tech weaponry. Taking them out
    quickly will be critical to avoid collateral damage.


    Stay sharp, heroes,
    and let''s keep those roads safe!'
